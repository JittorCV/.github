# JittorCV

This is an organization presented by [Qibin Hou](https://houqb.github.io/) from the [Media Computing Lab](https://mmcheng.net/) at Nankai University led by Ming-Ming Cheng. The goal is to provide wonderful computer vision projects based on the [Jittor](https://cg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/jittor/) framework.

At present, we have offered four projects, namely

- JittorCls. An image classification repo.
- JittorDet. An object detection repo.
- JittorSeg. A semantic segmentation repo.
- JittorDiffusion. A diffusion-based repo for image content generation.

If you are also interested in developing new projects, welcome to contact us via houqb@nankai.edu.cn.
